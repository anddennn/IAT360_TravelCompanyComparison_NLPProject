Due to a system error on Expedia’s side, I was unable to choose a different drop-off location for the car, and I was forced to return it to the same place I picked it up, even though my return flight was from a different airport. Despite contacting Expedia support multiple times, they did nothing to help me. Because of Expedia’s system issue, I ended up having to pay an additional $400.November 27, 2025Unprompted review",0

"Does not operate in good faithOn a last-minute booking in Japan, Expedia provided me with confirmation that I had booked 3 rooms. The hotel's app, however, showed that I had only booked 1 room. This was a non-traditional hotel with no front desk, so had I shown up via taxi with my group only to find out there was only 1 room, we would have been up a creek, so to speak. So I did what I had to do given the glitch and reached out to cancel the booking. Mind  you, this was within 10 minutes. The hotel refused, and so Expedia refused to refund me, despite this being caused by a glitch in either their system or the hotel's. I was forced to dispute the charge with my credit card.

"Expedia will lie to you and take your moneyExpedia took $111 from my account they claim that American Airlines has it and their policy is not to return it.

I then contacted Expedia who told me once again that American Airlines has the money. I cannot trust Expedia I feel they’re lying to me and I will never use them again over $111 I tell everyone I talk to and I post every chance I get the straight up. Lie is unacceptable.

"Expedia allows fraudulent listings and leaves customers stranded in foreign countriesExpedia and its partner websites have fraudulent listings for hotels that do not exist. I realized this hotel did not actually exist about an hour after booking, I tried to get in contact with the property not to cancel, but to get more information on the property to verify its legitimacy. Obviously, I did not get a response from a hotel that doesn't exist. Expedia said they would contact them on my behalf to request a refund and their team was also (obviously) not able to get in contact with the property. I found a review from another customer who booked one of these properties and was left stranded with no place to stay with her family in a foreign country. If I can verify these listings don't exist, Expedia can too, but they continue to allow them to operate so they can profit while endangering their customers. November 22, 2025Unprompted review",0

"Double charged - Will never use againWill never use again.  Had to book an emergency trip for my wife.  Found the best flight to get her to east coast as quickly as possible and clicked button to purchase.  Website spun for 3 minutes then told me the purchase failed.  Went through the whole process again and got a ticket.  Next, I was getting e-mails showing 2 separate reservations.  Called customer service who assured me the first charge was only a hold and would be cancelled.  A month later, both charges are still on my card.  Expedia swears the first one was cancelled, statement says otherwise, so does the airline.  Credit card company says charge is legitimate and airline won't refund either.

"Expedia no partner for guests and hotelsExpedia should partner with hotels and service their mutual guests. When a property does not give availability and does not confirm a reservation expedia sends via email... it is the problem of the hotel and the guest: expedia collects money and is not interested if THEY made a mistake, The hotel and guest should resolve the problem.

"I’m writing this review to warn others…I’m writing this review to warn others about a very misleading and disappointing experience. I booked a flight + hotel package through Expedia, assuming that the flights and hotel would be compatible. After booking, the hotel emailed me to say their check-in closes at 5 PM—which is shocking for any property, especially one being sold as part of an evening-arrival package. My flight, which Expedia paired with this hotel, wasn’t scheduled to land until 8 PM, making it impossible to arrive in time.Because of this, I had no choice but to cancel. While the hotel’s policy may have been technically “clear,” it is completely unreasonable for a hotel to participate in package deals while enforcing a check-in time earlier than most people’s workday even ends. A hotel offering check-in only until 5 PM should be upfront about this before purchase—not after the booking is completed.Expedia attempted to contact the hotel on my behalf for a refund, but the hotel refused to provide any accommodation, flexibility, or even basic understanding of the situation. Their stance felt rigid and customer-unfriendly, especially given that the timing issue was not caused by me.To add insult to injury, I’m a Platinum Expedia member, yet because the hotel was cancelled (without refund), I’m also denied Expedia points, even though I still paid the fees.Between Expedia selling an incompatible package and the hotel refusing to work with guests who physically can’t meet their unusual check-in window, the entire situation feels scammy and unfair. If you’re considering booking this hotel—or any package with Expedia—be extremely cautious.November 23, 2025Unprompted review",0
"My Bangkok to Chiang-Mai flight was…non existentMy Bangkok to Chiang-Mai flight was never booked and Bangok Air couldn't get me on a flight.  This caused me all kinds of problems and customer service at Expedia was zero help and frankly rude.  I've used Expedia before but never again.

"Just Like the MafiaUse these people and you will lose money, not save it.   You have to sort through all the airlines' policies and ignore their statements to know what is refundable.  Typical scenario:  Round-trip airline flight and a hotel.  You print the itinerary and there it is all laid out on one page in columnar format.  At the top of the page it says, ""No fee if cancelled before December 9"".  That's the hotel.  It's up to you to know the airlines' policy which has nothing to do with their statement.  Yeah, just like the hotel has their own policy.  Which doesn't apply because you're going through Expedia.  But the airlines' policy DOES apply.  I just lost $500 with their doing that.Also, they're an online, software based travel integrator.  The software is typical IT fraud that does not ever work right.  #1 sin for a business like that, they have very poor integration with what they offer.  If you book a fully refundable room, then decide to cancel within the grace period...you can't!  The hotel cannot do it and you have to do it through Expedia.  I had a room at a hotel that was willing to give me a refund on a fully refundable room as my wife had become ill at the last second and I couldn't call until the next day- but they couldn't because it was booked through Expedia.  They said I had to work with them, they could call the hotel, everything was fine with them about the refund.  Good luck trying to get that done with Expedia.  Bottom line, Expedia tells you to call the hotel.  ""Oh, we can't make changes with Spirit Airlines.  You have to call them yourself"" (why am I using this in the first place...)  OK.  They don't have a phone number.  The vitual assistant is total crap.  So you jump through hoops to cancel with Spirit, and Expedia still shows you're booked.  I was able to dig up a phone number (800-319-4834) and ask to have the data fixed.  ""Oh, Spirit won't let us do that"".  I'll fix that; I'll delete the account.  ""Oh, you can't delete the account because you haven't completed your trip"".  Talked to a real person.  ""Yeah I don't see anyway to clear the cancelled reservation.  You'll have to wait until the completed trip would be complete, then delete it.""  This is like doing business with the mafia.  You're going to pay more than you expected and you can't get out.November 23, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Expedia Sucks hind tit!I booked three excursions before leaving the US to travel to Morocco and they were all confirmed and paid for.To my cinsternation, I was not contacted by the tour operators about pickup and other details for my tours. I checked the details of my Expedia bookings and did not find any contact details. Contacted Expedia and all they offered were pitiful apologies every two seconds.  Spent half hour on the phone,  incurring long distance calls from Morocco only to be offered apologies and how they can't contact the your operators!

"Service Quality Has Declined SignificantlyI’ve been a loyal Expedia customer for over 10 years and have spent thousands of dollars booking flights and hotels through them. Unfortunately, my recent experiences have made me lose all trust in their customer service.Anytime I cancel a flight and receive travel credit, using that credit later becomes almost impossible. When I tried to rebook my flight for new dates, I was passed from agent to agent, kept on hold for hours, and still got nowhere. I had to give up and try again on another day.The next agent told me there were “no seats available” for the date I wanted. But when I checked on Booking.com, I was able to secure two seats immediately for that exact same day. This wasn’t the first time an Expedia agent gave me information that turned out to be untrue, and it honestly feels like they just didn’t want me to use my travel credits.This has happened more than once, and after years of loyalty, I’m extremely disappointed. I no longer feel that Expedia values their long-term customers or provides honest, helpful support.At this point, Booking.com has been far more reliable — and I’ll be using them going forward.November 10, 2025Unprompted review",0

"Very disappointing customer service…Very disappointing customer service from Expedia despite being a loyal member for years.I have used Expedia for more than seven years, spending over $15,000 USD on hotel bookings and travel. I always trusted their policies and support — until this trip.On November 20, I traveled by road with my family from Qatar to Dammam and booked two hotel rooms through Expedia. Due to a mistake while booking on the road, the reservation date appeared as November 26–27 instead of November 20–21.I immediately contacted Expedia on the same day. I was told it would be handled within 24–48 hours. During this waiting period, I stayed in the same hotel for three nights, paying separately through cash, Agoda, and Expedia, spending over $1,200 USD with the property while waiting for Expedia to solve the issue.I spent hours on calls and chats with multiple agents. Each time I was told to wait, and that a solution would be arranged by the hotel. After several days, the final response was:“The booking is non-refundable and non-changeable due to strict hotel rules.”I did not request a refund.I only asked to modify the date of a night that was never used, while I was a guest already staying and paying at the same hotel.Instead of protecting a loyal customer, Expedia kept sending me back and forth between the hotel and customer service, wasting my time for days and then hiding behind “policy.”Policies should prevent fraud, not punish loyal customers who prove they are honest and already paying more to the same hotel. Expedia’s role should be to support and protect us, not simply repeat the hotel’s refusal.This experience broke my trust in Expedia. Loyalty and thousands of dollars spent should mean something. I hope management reviews how such cases are handled, because losing loyal customers over a single unused modifying-night is simply bad business.November 22, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Indian scam company Unfortunately had to reschedule my flight because of sickness, and got scammed by Expedia. I had refundable premium select tickets (shout out to Delta for saving my ahh), but when I called Expedia to reschedule they wanted me to pay about 250 USD to keep my class. What ended up happening was they downgraded me, ghosted me in my language, and refered me to Indians that pretended they weren't Indians. Then they started sending me unofficial emails about paying 2500 USD to upgrade me back. I had to reschedule again through Delta for free, after 15 failed calls to Expedia.I tried reporting them to my country's financial fraud department, but the case was closed immediately because I only got scammed for 250 USD, they get so many calls about Expedia, they couldn't be bothered by mine. Apparently even they aren't able to contact Expedia without a reservation, and if they do get through they are immediately put on indefinite hold in India, which costs a lot with international roaming fees. I'm definitely doing more research next time I order.November 6, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Reservation missingI booked two rooms for two nights in Charleston, SC.  When I checked in the hotel said they had only one reservation for two nights.  I gave that to the people who were coming in from Chicago.  i asked the hotel if I could book another room for the two nights.  They only had one room for the first night we were staying there.  I took it at a rate that was about $100 more than the original reservation price.  Then I had to find another hotel for the second night.  I found one very near the first hotel and booked it.  The price was over $400 more than my original reservation.  When I asked Expedia to compensate me for the difference between the original booked price and what I actually incurred, they said no.  Bottom line: make a copy of your reservation details, take it with you and then GOOK LUCK!  November 12, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Expedia scamI reserved a room, paid for it, and canceled this room through Expedia.  In the event I needed to cancel I bought the travel insurance through your site.I canceled for legitimate reasons well in advance of the arrival date.  My experience:No refund from ExpediaNo coverage through the travel insurance you referred to meMy mistake, I should have booked the room through their website.  I could have canceled up to 6:00 of the arrival date and received a full refund.This is a totally unacceptable outcome.  I will use your reply to inform myself and share with others that there is no need to use Expedia for booking a room.  If you have to cancel, they will keep your money, cancel the room with the hotel and walk away with the proceeds.  The insurance coverage is a scam.

"Unethical false review ratingsI booked two family members who were traveling down from Ohio two separate rooms based on ""good"" reviews from Expedia.  When they arrived after driving all day from Ohio, I was informed that they found bedbugs in the corner of the mattress and both rooms smelled of mildew.  The second room had a bare light switch exposed in the bathroom, and the toilet would not flush.  After speaking with the front desk, my family members were told they would be refunded, since they were not comfortable staying there and had to go to a different hotel up the street.  My brother was told the refund would appear in a couple of days.  No refund was ever issued.  Expedia was no help and said the property refused to refund the rooms.  $800 wasted because this hotel refused a refund on rooms that are not inhabitable.  Disgusting and unethical.

"I am extremely disappointed with both…I am extremely disappointed with both Expedia and Sixt, and I feel obligated to warn other customers about what happened to me.I booked a rental car through Expedia, paid $392.81, and traveled using Uber (over $100 spent) to pick up the vehicle at Sixt’s office at Philadelphia International Airport (3601 Island Ave). When I arrived, Sixt refused to accept my credit card, even though the same card worked perfectly on Expedia during payment. They offered no help, no alternative solution, and no refund on the spot.Because of this refusal:	•	My money was held for 7 business days, leaving me with no access to funds.	•	I lost the job shift I was scheduled to work, which was supposed to pay me $200.	•	I had no transportation to return home except more expensive Uber rides.	•	I was left stranded with no income and no food, completely due to their failure.What makes this worse is the lack of responsibility:Expedia blames Sixt, and Sixt blames Expedia, while the customer suffers in the middle.Sixt’s staff showed zero empathy, despite the fact that I had already paid and traveled a long distance to their office. I was simply dismissed even after explaining my situation.This experience has caused me:	•	Financial loss	•	Stress and wasted time	•	Work income loss	•	Transportation problems	•	A week-long hold on my money when I needed it the mostNo customer deserves to go through this.I will never book with Expedia or Sixt again, and I strongly advise others to be extremely careful before trusting these companies.

"Serious data-sharing and brand-damaging by Expedia that every hotelier should be aware ofI am posting this review to warn other hoteliers about practices that can seriously damage your brand without your knowledge.We recently discovered that Expedia Private Label Solutions was sharing our property listings, photos, data and even room descriptions with unverified third-party websites that we had never heard of and never authorized.Two of these websites were:• VaudHotels – which displays photos of rooms that do not even exist in our property, cannot be contacted, and has no legal information available anywhere online• HotelsOne.com – whose management confirmed in writing that they receive our listings directly from Expedia Private Label SolutionsBoth of these websites have already been reported to the Swiss authorities, and I am prepared to do the same with Expedia if this continues.The most concerning part is that when I asked Expedia for the full list of OTA partners, affiliates, and resellers who receive our data, they refused to provide it.This means that there are certainly more websites out there using our name, our rooms, our prices, and our photos without our authorization – and Expedia will not tell us who they are.This raises serious issues:• Damage to brand image and reputation• Incorrect prices and misleading information published without your knowledge• Non-existent room types circulating on the internet under your name• Guests unable to reach these “partners,” blaming the hotel instead• Lack of transparency by Expedia despite repeated written requestsExpedia is the only OTA with which we have ever experienced such chaos and lack of transparency.We work with many other channels and have never encountered anything comparable.If you are a hotelier, check where your listings are appearing.Your property may be published on dozens of unauthorized websites through Expedia’s private-label distribution chain, without your consent and without your knowledge.This type of data dispersion is not only unprofessional – it is potentially unlawful.Proceed with extreme caution.The GMNovember 18, 2025Unprompted review",0

They cannot call you back, the phone will not ring. It just goes straight to voicemail and they don't leave one. They won't follow up with information in the email, it just starts you again in the loop from square one to complain to the floor again.

They don't understand your complaint and spend hours investigating the wrong issue. Only threatening to talk to the commerce commission got them to seek other answers, even then, still gets auto cut off and you ring back to start from scratch again.

As a result, I lost the package discount I originally had. This is extremely frustrating and feels unfair, especially since I contacted them immediately and followed their instructions.Overall, Expedia’s lack of flexibility and support in a situation caused by their own confusing listings has left me very dissatisfied. I will reconsider using their platform in the future.November 15, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Utterly terrible business and customer serviceBeen talking to 4 customer service including 1 in escalation line, total adding more than 5 hours so far - still waiting. Same experience from them all - do not care about customer and keeps lying.It is very frustrating to deal with the customer service. They are not helpful at all and most of the time useless. 3 calls last 3 hours more. 1) First call, they asked me to pay for the change of the ticket by using USD, and I need to bear the exchange transaction fee, 2) 2nd call they changed the flight to a wrong time, and asked me to pay again if I want to change to the the correct time because the airline is going to charge them. This customer service pretended the signal is cut off and hung up on me. 3) 3rd call they told me it takes a few days to get this sorted between Expedia and British Airway to see who is responsible for the wrong flight time. 4) escalation line. The customer service keeps saying I need to hold for a few more minutes. I am still waiting, for 2 hours 56 mins so far. Utterly poor and unbearable service -  I am the customer being penalized.November 14, 2025Unprompted review",0
"False Booking InformationExpedia allow their properties to falsely advertise as a “payment at property”, I booked a hotel for a trip away at Christmas and was shocked when they tried to take payment 3 months before. I cancelled and rebooked another, thinking it was just the hotel. The second booking also did this, and when confronting Expedia I was met with AI responses and copy and paste paragraphs about how their “vendors” did this to protect themselves for cancellations. I booked the property advertised as free cancellation up until the day before, and payment at property upon arrival. They ignored my questions about their acknowledgement in the false advertisements and continued to tell me it was for cancellation purposes. Perhaps don’t allow a payment at property with free cancellation option if you’re not going to honour it. A shame as I’ve used this company for years, but definitely won’t be using again.

"Just like AirBnb No accountability No fixesJust like AirBnb, Expedia has farmed out its customer service overseas. There is no accountability and no solutions to bait and switch tactics. Just plan on arriving to your resort and getting a totally different room setup than you paid for. Plus, as you are not buying directly from the resort,  you will get the older, dirtier and smellier units. Expedias solution and compensation to any problem is to give you a small pittance of One Key Cash, which you can use to purchase another sub-optimal accommodation from their site ONLY!.  Stopped using AirBNB 2 years ago for the exact same reason.  Vote NO with your wallet to using Expedia. November 13, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Good work expedia for being a crap…Good work expedia for being a crap partner. How hard is it too give me MY money. You have taken your commission but make it a convaluted and stupid way for me to get mine.November 13, 2025Unprompted review",0
"A national emergency in US airspace prevented prepaid hotel accomodationsI had booked and prepaid a two-night stay at The Relais Henley in Henley on Thames through Expedia as part of an 18-day itinerary that included all flights, hotels, and activities. I did not have insurance on the hotel stay. The Relais Henley itself was charming, and my modern king river-view room with half-board was excellent, though guests should be aware of the step coming out of the shower.The issue arose because my travel dates coincided with the US government shutdown. Following the shutdown, the head of the FAA announced the cancellation of approximately 10 percent of flights across the United States, creating what was effectively a national emergency in US airspace. My American Airlines flight to London Heathrow was one of those canceled. Fortunately, American Airlines rebooked my otherwise non-refundable flight for the following day at no charge because the disruption was directly tied to that emergency.Immediately after the cancellation, I called Expedia to alert them that I would arrive in the UK a full day late and would not be able to use the first night of my prepaid reservation at The Relais Henley. I requested an exception or refund for that missed night given the extraordinary circumstances.After lengthy explanations and time on hold, the Expedia agent told me that the decision rested with the hotel’s manager. He said he had already contacted the hotel, that the manager would not be in until the next morning, and that Expedia would update me the following day.  When I called again the next morning, I was told not to worry and that I should simply check in for my second night. I was told that speaking with the manager directly at check-in would resolve the matter.When I arrived at the hotel, the manager was not available. I was told I could speak with him the next morning. After several attempts, I finally reached him, only to be told that the refund decision was entirely up to Expedia. According to the manager, commissions had already been paid to Expedia, and there was nothing the hotel could do.Given the circumstances —a government-induced national aviation disruption, an unavoidable flight cancellation, and conflicting guidance between Expedia and the hotel — I would have expected Expedia to show more flexibility and accountability. This situation was clearly outside my control, and the inconsistent communication made a difficult travel disruption even more frustrating.November 11, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Car Rental ScamBooked a car through Expedia with Priceless Car Rental in Tampa — total scam. When I arrived, the company refused to release the car unless I bought their insurance, even though I had full coverage. Expedia refused to help or issue a refund, simply repeating the rental company’s bogus policy that was never disclosed at booking.Expedia clearly doesn’t vet or hold their partners accountable, and they leave customers on their own when a supplier behaves dishonestly. Beware — booking through Expedia offers no real protection when their vendors break the rules.November 8, 2025Unprompted review",0

"We booked a one-way car rental from…We booked a one-way car rental from Belém to Salvador (Brazil) through Expedia, and nowhere during the booking process did it mention that there would be a substantial extra fee for the one-way drop-off.When we arrived at the car rental counter (Unidad, acting for Avis), we were told we had to pay a large additional amount. Had we known about this fee, we would never have booked this car, but by then we already had hotels reserved along the route and had no choice but to proceed.Expedia tried to contact the car rental company on our behalf but could not get the fee waived. Still, the problem was caused by Expedia’s lack of transparency — the extra cost should have been clearly shown before booking.Very disappointing experience, especially since we usually check all details carefully. Future travelers should be aware that one-way rental fees may not be displayed upfront on Expedia.October 17, 2025Unprompted review",0

"We had our Visa card blockedWe had our Visa card blocked, unknowingly, due to Viator, trying to charge us $2206.00.  We did not buy anything from them or Tripadvisor.

So it was not an employee ripping us off, it was Viator.  The person on the chat had not empathy towards the situation and asked what I would like them to do!!!!

"A Better Dispute Mechanism Required for Unreasonable ReviewsThe review system seems to have some inherit flaws with respect to the currency and competency of the people leaving reviews. Many of the reviews are not always reflective of the experience you have received at a local restaurant or facility. Also, it appears that the business operator has very little recourse to dispute reviews that seem unreasonable.This may have been a reason for the situation at a resort in the Philippines where an owner decided to go to court to find remedy through their court system. It seems to be a last resort to prevent defamation against small business operators against unreasonable customers. It's a shame that there is no dispute mechanism to deal with such deputes. It seems to be an ongoing problem with many sites such as Yelp & Google as well.January 14, 2021Unprompted review",1

Prime example is we just got back from Secrets - the Vine in Cancun and although the resort/hotel identifies itself as wheelchair accessible it is not. There is no access to the beach. Only very steep steps going from the pool area to the beach. In addition, the ramp from the hotel to the pool area and some of the restaurants was also very step. Going down was OK but I had to get help to get up the ramp. I will say however that the staff were happy to help push me up the ramp.

Some are negative and will never be pleased. I have done many reviews all over the world in fact many I haven’t done as I did not have time.

"As a property host....I absolutely hate…As a property host....I absolutely hate Booking.com. I just started listing my properties on here a couple of weeks ago. It is completely useless and infuriating. I've been on the phone for about and hour trying to sort out why both of my properties have two separate wrong addresses attached to them. One of them is 4 hours drive from my exact locations. The other is 1hr from where the property actually is. I'm being told by a booking.com agent that the problem is that the company is relying too much on AI to set up the accounts/properties. Another incredibly annoying thing is that AI chooses what are 'local attractions' in the listing. And on my properties - despite the fact that booking.com is telling potential booking customers that one of my properties is not too far from Newcastle - that a local attraction is Bristol Airport (4 hours away).  First of all...an airport is hardly an 'attraction'. The other day i looked at my listings and other property listed Southampton Cruise Terminal as an 'attraction'I've been renting out through Airbnb for over 4 years and it is brilliant compared to this. Their customer service is brilliant and their website is logical, efficient and accurate! Lastly my third ever Booking.com customer sent me a message saying she wanted to extend her stay by one day. So I went to 'change dates' and selected the extra day on the calendar only to be greeted by a message saying 'oops the date is not possible - please make sure the length of stay remains the same'. How useless is that? So after a long old period on hold again I was told by an agent it's not possible to change it myself without requesting a change through an agent. The tech support person told me that I could tell the customer to 'self request' the date change. I asked if it would be obvious for her how to find the 'self request' part on the site. I was told that 'because I can see that she hasn't had much experience on Booking.com she probably won't be able to find it'!!No wonder Booking.com has only 2 stars on Trustpilot!November 30, 2025Unprompted review",0

"Unethical & Shady Corporation My fiancée, and I booked a room on the night of the 27th at LaQuinta Inn. Due to an unforeseen issue we were not able to make it to LaQuinta Inn. When we attempted to cancel the booking through LaQuinta Inn we were urged to call Booking.Com. I attempted to call Booking.Com but could not get ahold of a live representative, and was told by the automated system that the booking couldn’t be cancelled. Upon looking at the confirmation email the next morning  I saw where it said cancellations will not be refunded. I thought surely being that we never checked in they would have enough integrity to refund the money but instead their trifling asses did the unthinkable. They refunded back a measly ass $2.50 even though we never checked in nor used the room. I am appalled, and absolutely disgusted because I usually never book through third party sites. This was a last minute ordeal so I thought it would be easier. It was a slap in the face not only to us but to our three children as well. We were going to finally be able to spend time as a family after living apart for months. How hard was it to refund the money back especially given the fact that we never checked in? This has NOW led to me exposing the UNETHICAL, SCAMMING, & UNPROFESSIONAL character of Booking.Com! I would like a follow up with the resolution being a full refund otherwise I’m going to the higher up. November 27, 2025Unprompted review",0
"I genuinely dislike leaving negative reviews, but this is warranted…I genuinely dislike leaving negative reviews, but after my recent experience I feel I have no choice. I have honestly never had a more unhelpful customer experience, and it’s quite sad that a company of this size operates this way.I needed something extremely simple: to update my email address, as my previous one had been hacked. I still have access to the app, but I can't self serve because the verification code for an email change keeps being sent to the old address - which I obviously can’t access. So I contacted customer service for help.After 25 minutes on the phone, the call was cut off and nobody called me back. I then rang again and spent another lengthy call explaining the issue. What followed was beyond frustrating:I was repeatedly told that my account “didn’t exist” - despite giving the exact email address the agent later admitted was on the account.The agent could not pull up my profile until I provided a booking reference, at which point he immediately found it. This alone suggests their CRM system is seriously unreliable.I was told that updating my email would cause me to lose my Genius Level 3 status, which makes absolutely no sense. It’s the same account, just a change of contact detail - I’ve never heard of loyalty tiers being wiped for updating contact information.After going through all of this, the agent casually informed me that he was not able to update my email address anyway. This was after a lengthly time on the phone. A customers service team can't update my details...? I was prompted to update manually following his instructions. The instructions he gave me were the exact steps I had already followed in the app, which do not work (sends verification to my old email).He then mentioned an option to add an additional email address - something my account apparently doesn’t have because it was created in 2023, whereas older accounts do. The idea that newer accounts have fewer capabilities than older ones is completely illogical and reflects extremely poor product design.Finally, he said he would “speak to the relevant team”, but I cannot contact them myself. He told me they would reach out via email… to an email address I cannot access. The entire process is a shambles. I asked him to update my contact email so they didn't contact the old one... he informs me he can't contact them again because he'd be breaching internal policy?! My head was scrambled. Thankfully they have my correct details now.What should be one of the most basic features - updating an email address - is somehow made impossible. There is no reason an engineering team couldn’t enable this, and no reason a customer service team shouldn’t be able to assist. Even reinstating a Genius tier after an update would be a trivial solution if the system really is so fragile.To be put through contradictory information, false assurances, long phone calls, and ultimately no resolution is incredibly disappointing. It genuinely feels like the process is designed to be as difficult and frustrating as possible.Overall, this was a shockingly poor customer experience, and I’m left with an account tied to an email I can’t access, no solution, and no confidence in the support team’s ability to resolve even the simplest issue. All I wanted to do was book more travel through them...November 30, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Flight Scam on change charges Booked a flight on Thursday , needed to change it last minute, Booking.com plus Partner gotogate couldnt change it in the first attempt, they said you should go to the airline, went to the airline and then back to booking.com, they wanted to charge me 1500 euro to change the flight saying this is the airline policy.

"Booking.com protects fraudsters, and no response for travelersFor us, booking.com was a great way to get defrauded. We arrived in Southampton, England with our entire family of 6 having booked one night in Poole before a cruise on the Cunard line.

"This experience has severely undermined our trust.I booked an apartment through Booking.com for my family, including our 3-year-old child. We selected Apartamentos Portodouro – Santa Catarina specifically because of the location, the advertised view, and the reassurance that the accommodation was suitable for families.However, upon arrival we discovered:The apartment was NOT at the address stated on Booking.com.The room provided was NOT the one we booked — different layout, different quality, different conditions.The view advertised did not correspond to reality.The staff behaved unprofessionally, with a dismissive and disrespectful attitude, telling us essentially to “take it or leave it” because there were other customers.This is a clear case of misrepresentation and incorrect listing information, which violates consumer protection standards in the EU.When we contacted Booking.com for assistance, we were shocked to find that they defended the property instead of addressing the fraudulent aspects of the listing. As a customer traveling with a small child, we expected Booking.com to uphold their own policy regarding misleading descriptions and incorrect accommodation information.This experience has severely undermined our trust.June 27, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Bait & Switch! I strongly warn anyone considering this I strongly warn anyone considering this listing: the location and building shown on Booking.com were false. The listing repeatedly displayed the Apple Gangnam flagship store address, including its map pin and photos of that building. That is one of the most recognizable and prestigious spots in Seoul. When I arrived after two days of travel, the apartment simply did not exist at that address.Because of this false location, I spent over four hours past midnight dragging luggage through unfamiliar streets. The host did not respond when I needed help. I only located the real building because a stranger took pity on me and guided me through multiple back alleys to a tiny older building hidden behind a very small convenience store—absolutely nothing like the Apple Gangnam address shown online.Inside, the conditions were far below basic standards. There was no toilet paper for the first four days and no dry towels for two days, even though I arrived late at night exhausted and needing to shower. In the bathroom, instead of clean supplies, I found a dried-up old bar of soap, a used empty toothpaste tube, a used shower cap, and a used plastic cup left behind.The bedding had just been washed and was still hanging to dry throughout the room, leaving almost no space to move. The only sheet on the bed was so thin that the impressions of the mattress coils were clearly visible through it, making the bed extremely uncomfortable to sleep on. Wet laundry took up a large portion of the small room.The “full kitchen” was unusable: there were no pots, no pans, no utensils, and several appliances had no instructions at all. The actual building was old and worn, nothing like the modern unit shown in the listing photos.Communication from the host was poor throughout the stay, and at checkout she sent an unnecessarily threatening message, which felt completely inappropriate given the state of the apartment.This stay was nothing like what was advertised. The address was false, the building was misrepresented, basic essentials were missing, and the conditions were unacceptable. I’m sharing this so others do not go through what I went through. There are many honest listings in Seoul—this was not one of them.November 9, 2025Unprompted review",0
"Extra fee to change ticket was useless & false advertisingI spent $50 more on my plane ticket from LAX to BKK so that I could change it once if need be. As it turns out, I needed to change it. I went through the Booking portal clicking on my flight and then clicking on change ticket. Today alone, there were several options that came up to change the ticket for $0.00 more - no new fees, taxes. However, each time I clicked on my exact new desired flight/date, I was brought to a chat with a Booking rep who had no information at all about my reason for contacting chat/help (for example, they didn’t know that I chose a specific new ticket (which begs the question: why was I instructed by the website to click on an exact new flight?). But what’s worse is that they proceeded to quote me prices of approx $200 more to change my ticket to that new date/flight. I spent the entire afternoon dealing with this, including talking to a rep on the phone who had no idea that there even was a part of your website that shows flight availability and extra cost to canoe a specific ticket. So I spent $50 extra for nothing but wasting an afternoon in vain trying to change my ticket. Booking.com needs to change their website's useless and misleading protocol for changing a flight.November 29, 2025Unprompted review",0

No Wi-Fi as no password given, no tea/coffee making facilities, no lift key on arrival (the lift didn't work anyway so 78 stairs to deal with each day), huge, dirty brown stain on the mattress, dust and hair in the apartment, wet, smelly mop left in the hallway, stinking rubbish left outside the front door of the apartment – nothing quality about this place! Booking.com customer service is a pathetic – they kept asking for messages between myself and the “host” as proof of the issues – despite sending ALL the messages to Booking.com, they fell silent and refuse to refund the amount paid. Clearly, they are only interested in taking your money but have no morals or principles whatsoever! Absolutely disgraceful!October 23, 2025Unprompted review",0

"Please don't use them I’ve used them for over 10 years, and they were always a reliable and trustworthy agent.However, their service quality has recently dropped to an unacceptable level. They now partner with some awful companies that take money upfront, abandon you upon arrival at your destination, and provide no support. Booking.com’s customer service is unavailable during these emergencies, and there is no help with refunds or follow-ups. It has cost me a fortune for the mistake of booking my holiday through this platform.September 24, 2025Unprompted review",0

"⭐ 1/10 — Extremely disappointed after 10+ years with Booking.com ⭐I’ve been with Booking.com for over a decade and reached their highest Genius 3 level, but this experience honestly shocked me. I lost around €625 on a 32-night booking, and instead of helping or even trying to understand the situation, Booking.com just kept sending me back to the property, HeyLola Barcelona, to “resolve it directly.”I reached out to Booking.com support, customer care, their media team on X, and even emailed the CEO, Glenn Fogel — and got zero response from anyone. Not one person bothered to actually read the details, look at the refund policy, or check the proof of payments I sent, including the city tax that was charged upfront.HeyLola themselves had agreed in writing to refund the city tax (€138.60 total - €46.20 for each booking) once I cancelled the reservations. I did everything exactly as requested, sent confirmations, backed it up with emails… and they still never refunded anything. They just disappeared, knowing full well Booking.com wasn’t stepping in to protect a loyal customer.It’s honestly heartbreaking to see that after all these years, after hundreds of nights booked without a single complaint, the moment I faced a real and genuine situation, Booking.com didn’t support me at all. No accountability, no follow-up, no help, just silence.For a platform this big, the lack of responsibility is extremely disappointing. Loyalty clearly means nothing when something goes wrong. I expected way better.November 21, 2025Unprompted review",0
"We are very disappointed with…We are very disappointed with Booking.comThey do not protect their customers at all, they do not check whether people are real when they list their rented premises.Our situation was like this, my family and I rented an apartment in Paris through Booking.com. The reservation was irrevocable. When we got to the indicated apartment, there was no electricity, internet, heating, everything was dirty. We immediately contacted Booking.com, they promised to help, but we did not receive anything, and that scammer continues to rent the same apartment and Booking.com does nothing. You cannot take money from a client if you are not 100% sure that the landlord is real and everything is fine. What we saw was that you cannot pay immediately through Booking.com, because this platform is no longer safe and there is a high probability that you will lose your money. Booking.com answer was that we immediately paid the landlord, how can you pay immediately if the client says that the apartment is a mess, the photos are fake, etc.October 31, 2025Unprompted review",0

They are incredibly reliable—whether it's booking, inquiries, or last-minute changes, they always deliver with professionalism and care.One of the things I value most is their commitment to personal service. They always answer their landline promptly, and it’s always a real human on the other end—ready to help, not just route you through automated systems. Their customer service is truly exceptional: responsive, knowledgeable, and genuinely dedicated to guiding and supporting customers at any time.I’m especially thankful to Michal, Judy, and most recently Shahir for their continued professionalism and kindness.

"Family Holiday with no worries !!!We have only used a travel agent once, and that was over 20 years ago, when we did multi stop tour of South East Asia. Since then we have travelled all over the Caribbean, Asia and Europe and travelled as a couple and never used a travel agent. This time we wanted to do a family holiday of 15 people to somewhere in the Caribbean. So, we decided to engage a travel agent to facilitate this trip, which was Airline Ticket Centre. This was the best decision we ever made. The company and our agent Kari Pucci made the whole experience seamless, pleasant, worry free and best of all got the best deal and the best resort and within our budget.
